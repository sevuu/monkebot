# monkebot
Discord bot for general usage. Expect spaghetti code and a bit of untranslated commands.
Basically a family friendly version of https://github.com/sevuu/malpabot

%help for command list

# invite link

# installation
Python 3.7 or above. It might run on older versions but some commands will probably stop working properly. Try at your own risk. 

In bot directory:  
`pip install -r requirements.txt`  
Create **bottoken.py** file in **lib** directory and type in    
`token = "yourtoken"`  
If you can't get it to work on raspberry pi try:    
`sudo apt-get install libatlas-base-dev`
